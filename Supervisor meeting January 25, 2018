Supervisor meeting January 25, 2018

Wayne - finished the code for the map and wrote it on angular 1 - Szilard asks how difficult it is to port it to angular 2 - should not be too difficult - a few days to fix the code - Szilard wants an email from Wayne on monday saying that he fixed the code - also wants to make it integrated to the app

Github

Hermann - wrote angular code to access data from - cannot access the database - Luke can

Luke - working on PHP just have to change the variables to the variables that the angular code works, want to work on

Eric - working on scripting but have problems working with 

Bijan - finished tree objects and tree factory - waiting on data collection from PHP and Hermann's angular, working on logic behind owning trees and everything that goes with that 

database will read the excel sheet once to populate the database 

Nick Rhodes - ask him if he knows why we cannot access the database in anything but Windows

Hermann and Luke have most critical parts of the project right now and need to get done

Graham saw the app for the first time - wasn't a fan of how the buttons were working and has more types of trees that he wants data collected on 

for the final Szilard wants the documentation for the project - if done correctly will be easy, otherwise it will be difficult to write it all at the end 

by February 7th need a working demo of the app - does not have to be finished 

Presentation strucuter is the same as the fall presentation - state what is the problem, main challenges faced, exact tools with what you were planning on using - modules and how you split the work - code snippits to show - demo - updated schedule - the parts that are missing - conclusion - should be something like its running these parts are done and these parts are missing - presentation by next saturday or sunday, monday by the earliest 

for the presentation - need a screen caster for the demo on iphone while someone else mimics it on the tablet - tell the problems, do not hide things because someone might know what to do about it or how to fix it 

20 to 25 slides - 1 slide for technical - 1 slide for each - demo for the rest
